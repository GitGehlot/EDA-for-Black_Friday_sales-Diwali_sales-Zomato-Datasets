**Steps in EDA**

Data Collection: Gather the data from various sources such as databases, files, APIs, etc.
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, correct errors, and format the data properly.
Data Transformation: Convert data into a suitable format or structure for analysis, such as normalization, scaling, or encoding categorical variables.
Data Visualization: Use graphical representations to explore data patterns and relationships.
Statistical Analysis: Apply statistical techniques to summarize and understand data distributions and relationships.

**Key Techniques in EDA**

1. Data Cleaning
Handling Missing Values: Fill in missing values with mean/median/mode or use methods like forward fill or backward fill.
Removing Duplicates: Identify and remove duplicate records.
Correcting Data Types: Ensure data types are appropriate for analysis (e.g., converting strings to dates).

2. Descriptive Statistics
Summary Statistics: Compute measures like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, skewness, and kurtosis.
Frequency Distribution: Count the occurrences of different values in a dataset.

3. Data Visualization
   
Univariate Analysis: Analyze the distribution of a single variable.

>Histograms: Show the frequency distribution of a numerical variable.
>Box Plots: Display the distribution and identify outliers.
>Bar Charts: Visualize categorical data.

Bivariate Analysis: Explore the relationship between two variables.

>Scatter Plots: Show the relationship between two numerical variables.
>Correlation Matrix: Display the correlation coefficients between variables.
>Heatmaps: Visualize the magnitude of variables as colors in a matrix.

Multivariate Analysis: Analyze the interactions among multiple variables.

>Pair Plots: Show pairwise relationships in a dataset.
>Heatmaps: Visualize complex relationships between multiple variables.

4. Statistical Analysis
Correlation Analysis: Identify and measure the strength of relationships between variables.
Hypothesis Testing: Test assumptions or claims about the data using statistical tests like t-tests, chi-square tests, etc.

**Feature engineering** is crucial for improving the effectiveness of machine learning models. It involves creating, transforming, selecting, and scaling features to make the data more suitable for the learning algorithms, ultimately enhancing model performance.
